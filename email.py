# Please replace `"your_email@gmail.com"` and `"your_password_or_app_specific_password"` with your actual Gmail credentials. You can also modify the `mailbox_label` to select a specific label (e.g., `"Sent"`, `"Drafts"`, etc.). This code connects to Gmail, retrieves email subjects and sender information, and prints them out.
